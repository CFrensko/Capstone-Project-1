Capstone Project 1: Airbnb Price Point

When visiting a city for the first time or renting out your home it can be a struggle figuring out if you are getting a fair price for the Airbnb rental or whether you priced your home appropriately to make a profit. The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to calculate a fair approximate value for a home to assist renters and hosts using Airbnb. 

The data used for this project was pulled from AirBNBâ€™s website by Tom Slee (http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data) for the city of Chicago. The dates of the data are from 26 randomly selected days over the past five years. The data was downloaded as separate csv files for each date and joined them together to form one large dataframe totaling 159,181 rows. Below is a visual of the data used for this project. 

The data samples for Chicago will first be explored with data analysis along with data wrangling. After the data is cleaned, a linear regression machine learning model will be applied to predict the values of the homes. Later the data will be explored using supervised regression models including decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, multi-layer perceptron, gradient boosting, lasso regression, ridge regression and elastic net. Next feature importance analysis and hyper parameter tuning will be applied to the best model. These results will all be tied together to see the impact each factor may have on overall price. The deliverables for this project will be the code, this report detailing the work completed and a blog post telling the story.
