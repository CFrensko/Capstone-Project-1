The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to calculate a fair approximate value for a home to assist renters and hosts using Airbnb.\n",

    "Airbnb is an online platform that allows people to lease or rent short-term lodging in over 81,000 cities around the world. It is a popular service in the city of Chicago for visitors to use as an alternative to staying at hotels. If you are a homeowner or your apartment complex allows airbnb listings it can be a fun way to make extra money. In some cases it is also an opportunity to host visitors and share in the experience of welcoming a visitor to your city.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems with hopping on the website for the first time in a new city is figuring out what a reasonable price is for a unit when you are unfamiliar with the neighborhoods. As the customer looking for a rental, how do you determine a fair budget if the listings are sparse in one neighborhood without a range of equivalent prices? Maybe the neighborhood is a really beautiful niche but transportation to all the local entertainment will really cost you. What is your break even price point for an authentic experience, priceless? Maybe you should avoid the hassle and disappointment by booking a hotel instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be frustrating for a new host to structure the pricing of their unit without knowing the fair market value. You could be losing out on money by not following the market trends. Look at how much your friend just made last weekend with the music festival Lollapalooza in town. How do you make sure you are not undervaluing your home?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem would be to have a dynamic application that would give you a reasonable price range for a unit with your specifications in different neighborhoods. Instead of doing all that extra research you could just open the app and receive an instant unbiased transparent fair price estimation for your ideal home. This application could also be beneficial for pricing out monthly rental rates if you are planning on moving.\n",
    "The solution of the application lies in the ability of machine learning to do quick historical searches and comparisons of variables with supervised learning. The ideal supervised learning model would make the task of pricing your rental or finding a reasonably priced home seamless.\n"
